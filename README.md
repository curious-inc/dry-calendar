It's easy, it's robust, it's functional, it's extensible. Enjoy.

### dry.calendar

This is a node and browser module that is an abstraction of the calendar computations. It's the base class for the `client_calendar`, but it doesn't have any client side dependencies. There are good examples of usage in the tests: `lib/calendar.test.js`.

### dry.client_calendar

This is the client side html calendar.

This relies on `dry.underscore.js`, and jquery to work. There is a version of `dry.underscore.js` in the root of the repo. Take a look at the example for usage.

There is a pretty good example of the `client_calendar` functionality and styling in `example/example.html` and `example/css/example.css`.
